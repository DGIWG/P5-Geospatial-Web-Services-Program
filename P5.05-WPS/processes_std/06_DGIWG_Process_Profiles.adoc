== DGIWG Processes Description (Normative)

=== Introduction
This chapter defines DGIWG processes at a generic level. These definitions may be implemented through WPS or other APIs.
Following DGIWG processes are desribed below:

 - elevation analysis
 - distance mesurement
 - range rings
 - viewshed
 - slope helicopter landing zone
 - gazetteer
 - geopackage
 - geocoding
 - route calculation


=== Elevation analysis
==== Generic process : elevation analysis

Process

	  Identifier	http://www.dgiwg.org/service/processing/process/elevationanalysis
	  Title	Elevation analysis
	  Keywords	elevation, analysis, highest point, lowest point
	  Abstract	It provides lowest and highest point(s) on a given area.
	  Metadata

Input

	  Identifier	aoi
	  Title	Area of interest
	  Keywords
	  Abstract	Area of interest where a process will be executed. This could be a BBOX, a polygon, or any surface geometry.. (GM_Surface)
	  Metadata
	  Multiplicity	1

Input

	  Identifier	elavation_data
	  Title	elevationData
	  Keywords	elevation, height, Digital Surface Model, Digital Elevation Model
	  Abstract	Digital representation of the earth's surface. Elevation data on which the process will be executed. It may be internal data (with a choice for the users) or data provided by the user itself (URI, external service, …).
	  Metadata
	  Multiplicity	0..1

Input

	  Identifier	analysis_type
	  Title	Choice of highest or lowest points
	  Keywords
	  Abstract	Information providing if highest or lowest.
	  Metadata
	  Multiplicity	1

Output

	  Identifier	result_points
	  Title	Highest or lowest points
	  Keywords
	  Abstract	Highest or lowest points returned by the process on the provided area of interest. This may also contain metadata describing the data sources used, the vertical CRS of the result.
	  Metadata

==== Process implementation : elevation analysis
include here a WPS 2 example

=== Distance mesurement

==== Generic process : distance measurement

Process

	  Identifier	http://www.dgiwg.org/service/processing/process/distancemeasurement
	  Title	Distance measurement
	  Keywords	distance
	  Abstract	It provides the distance between two or more points.
	  Metadata

Input

	  Identifier	points_list
	  Title	List of points
	  Keywords
	  Abstract	List of two or more points in a given CRS. CRS may be 2D or 3D (with Z or height information).
	  Metadata
	  Multiplicity	1
	  Data format

Input

	  Identifier	measurement_method
	  Title	Method of measurement
	  Keywords
	  Abstract	Method of measurement to be used for the calculation (for example euclidean, geodesic, …). This could include Z coordinate (or height above elispoid).
	  Metadata
	  Multiplicity	0..1
	  Data format

Input

	  Identifier	uom
	  Title	Unit of measure
	  Keywords
	  Abstract	Unit of measure for the measured distance(s) to be returned.
	  Metadata
	  Multiplicity	1
	  Data format

Output

	  Identifier	distance_results
	  Title	Distance results
	  Keywords
	  Abstract	Result set containing indivual distance between each point pair and/or the sum. This should include uom.
	  Metadata
