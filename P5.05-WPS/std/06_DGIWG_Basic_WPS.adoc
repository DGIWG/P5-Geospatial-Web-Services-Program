=== Requirements for DGIWG Basic WPS/Geoprocessing service

==== General

WARNING: structure of requirement (DGIWG current style vs new OGC style), to be discussed in MANAGEMENT Team

*_Requirement {counter:req}: a DGIWG Basic WPS server shall implement the Basic WPS service profile conformance class <<Ref-1>>._*

NOTE: Basic WPS conformance class comprises the synchronous and asynchronous execution protocol, the WPS process model, and implements HTTP/POST+XML and HTTP/GET+KVP encodings.

==== GetCapabilities operation

*_Requirement {counter:req}: a DGIWG Basic WPS server shall implement provide elements in the GetCapabilities response as described in table <<get_cap>>._*

NOTE: The contents of the CI_ResponsibleParty class are modified to omit the optional organizationName attribute
in CI_ContactInfo, since the ProviderName contains this information. The mandatory ―role‖ attribute in the
CI_ResponsibleParty class is made optional, since no clear use of this information is known in the
ServiceProvider section. Since all contents of the ServiceContact are now optional, the ServiceContact is now
made optional.

=== Requirements for developping process profiles


NOTE: description of process profiles is defined in http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/14-065/14-065.html#32

TIP: A process profile is a description of a process on an interface level. Process profiles may have different levels of abstraction and cover several aspects. On a generic level, a process profile may only refer to the provided functionality of a process, i.e. by giving a verbal or formal definition how the outputs are derived from the inputs. On a concrete level a process profile may completely define inputs and outputs including data type definitions and formats.
Process profiles are blueprints for process implementations and are meant to harmonize process implementations to a certain degree. They serve as a reference for process implementations by providing a description of what the process actually does. While this specification does not attempt to enforce or suggest any particular process profiles, it provides a mechanism to define common processing functionality within the scope of WPS, thus supporting basic process cataloguing and retrieval tasks for distributed processing infrastructures. Depending on the degree of harmonization, the definitions of process profiles may be used to foster a common understanding of widely used processing functions. However, they may also be used to harmonize the technical details of process interfaces and thus document particular interoperability arrangements between process providers and consumers.
